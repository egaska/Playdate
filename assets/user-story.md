AS an individual with a busy schedule within a group of similar people
I WANT to find available times for everyone within my group
SO THAT we may plan a group activity that fits all group members’ schedules

GIVEN a log-in screen
WHEN I register or log-in as a user
THEN I am allowed access to the application

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to submit my schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the Proposal for the group activity is displayed at the top of the planner
AS WELL AS the Name, Time Length, and Date of the Proposal.

WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard waking hours of the day

GIVEN these timeblocks which contain input fields (?)
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can select whether or not I am available during that hour (?)

GIVEN that I have provided answers for each timeblock of that day
WHEN I click the Submit button for my schedule
THEN I will see a new version of the Daily Planner

GIVEN that this new version is a representation of the joined schedules of all users
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is a free time for all, or not


GIVEN that a series of “free” timeblocks are equal or greater to the activity Proposal’s length
WHEN I examine a produced output from the application
THEN I can see that a particular block of time is available for all users for the length of time needed for the Proposed activity
